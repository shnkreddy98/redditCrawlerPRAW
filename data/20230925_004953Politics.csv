0,Saturday Morning Political Cartoon Thread,"It's Saturday, folks. Let's all kick back with a cup of coffee and share some cartoons!

Feel free to share political cartoons in this thread. Besides our usual civility policy, there are three rules to follow:

1. Every top-level comment must contain a political cartoon. This means no text-only top-level comments.


2. It must be an original cartoon. This means no photographs, no edited cartoons, no AI generated images, no templates, no memes and no image macros. OC is allowed, as is animation.


3. Each top-level comment should only have a maximum of 3 cartoons. 


That's all. Enjoy your weekend!",optimalg,politics,1695481494.0,0.84,78,/r/politics/comments/16q6t37/saturday_morning_political_cartoon_thread/,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/16q6t37/saturday_morning_political_cartoon_thread/
