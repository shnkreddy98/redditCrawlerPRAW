That shutdown <a href="https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=57056932&itype=CMSID" target="_blank">cost the state millions of dollars in lost tourist revenue</a>. Then, Lee initially said he would not forego his pay during the shutdown, but later said he would <a href="https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=56951507&itype=CMSID">donate a portion of his pay to charity</a>.</p><p class="body-raw">During the two-day government shutdown in January 2018, Lee voted against a spending bill to reopen the government because it contained a long-term extension of a government surveillance program he worried was spying on Americans.
