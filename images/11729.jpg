            "articleBody": "A Scottish man says he was ''kidnapped'' by his own runaway electric car - forcing him to dodge red lights and roundabouts and call police to ram it off the road.\u00a0 Brian Morrison, 53, says his new posh motor started driving itself - and he had to dial 999 from inside.\u00a0 He had been heading home from work on Sunday when he says his brand new electric car decided to take control - and the brakes wouldn't work.\u00a0 Becoming stuck at 30mph, Morrison says his MG ZS EV fully electric vehicle suffered a ''catastrophic malfunction''.\u00a0 He called police who were forced to forcibly stop the runaway car by allowing it to slowly crash into their police van.\u00a0 Even after forcing the car to a halt, Morrison says that the car tried to keep moving once police tried moving their vehicle. A roadside repair mechanic later said they had \u0022never seen\u0022 anything like the incident.\u00a0 'I was completely trapped inside' Morrison, from Glasgow, Scotland, said that he was \u0022lucky\u0022 that the incident had taken place late at night at just after 10 pm BST.\u00a0 \u0022I realised something was wrong when I was coming up to a roundabout, and went to slow down - but it didn't do it,\u0022 he said.\u00a0 \u0022Then I heard a loud grinding noise that sounded like brake pads - but because it was such a new car I knew it couldn't be a problem with them.\u00a0 \u0022I managed to get around roundabout going at about 30mph, and then had a long road ahead of me, so I assumed it would stop without me accelerating - but it didn't. \u0022I have mobility issues, so I couldn't even jump out - I was completely trapped inside the car going at 30 mph [50 km/h],\u0022 he added.\u00a0 \u0022It might not sound like it is very fast, but when you have no control over the speed and you're completely stuck inside it's terrifying\u0022.\u00a0 Morrison initially called his partner in a panic to ask her to warn cars ahead of him that he could not stop his car.\u00a0 'The car was running away on its own' After realising that he would soon have to navigate traffic lights and several roundabouts, and worried about crashing into pedestrians, he eventually called emergency services.\u00a0 \u0022The car was just running away on its own, there was nothing I could do,\u0022 Morrison said. \u0022When I dialed 999 [UK emergency services], they sent police to help and put some engineers on the line to try and solve the problem, and they were asking if it was a self-driving car.\u00a0 \u0022It was the first time that the call handlers had experienced the issue, and they had no idea what to do.\u00a0 ''So eventually three police vehicles arrived and were driving in front of me and behind me.\u00a0 \u0022I was 100 per cent concentrating on my steering, so when a police van pulled up besides me and asked if I was Brian and if I was okay, I just yelled 'no I'm not, I can't stop'\u0022.\u00a0 Police initially tried having Morrison throw his electronic key through their van window before driving off - but this failed to disengage the engine.\u00a0 After that, they tried to get the driver to forcibly shut off the engine by pressing the power button three times, which also failed.\u00a0 He then was asked to hold the power button for over two seconds, which also failed to stop the car.\u00a0 Police then decided to get Brian to crash into the back of their van before he got into a more built-up area. Drove into the police van \u0022After trying to shut the car down, my entire dashboard lit up with faults, and then it all went away after a second and just had a big red car symbol that said 'drive safely, stop driving immediately' or something,\u0022 Morrison\u00a0said.\u00a0 \u0022Eventually I came up to a roundabout, which slowed the car down to about 15 mph [24 km/h], and the Police van was waiting for me on the other side.\u00a0 \u0022I went into the back of the van while it was moving before they put on the brakes to stop me. ''After that, a police officer jumped into my car and did something that seemed to keep the car still. \u0022After I got out though, they tried moving their van and the car kept going - so they had to sit with the van there for ages until the RAC got there.\u00a0 \u0022I still have no idea what happened, but when the RAC got to me about three hours later he plugged in the car to do a diagnostic check and there was pages of faults,\u0022 he added.\u00a0 \u0022He said he had never seen anything like it, and decided he was not willing to turn the engine on to see what was wrong.\u0022\u00a0 Morrison's insurance company says it is now investigating the incident which has left Brian questioning if he would drive another electric vehicle again. \u0022I don't know if I'll get another, frankly I've not even tried driving my wife's car - it was a terrifying experience,\u0022 Morrison said.\u00a0 \u0022Around 10.35 pm on Sunday, 1 October, we received a report of a driver unable to stop his electric car on the A803 heading towards Kirkintilloch,\u0022 a\u00a0Police Scotland spokesperson said.\u00a0 \u0022The car was travelling at a low speed and officers carried out a controlled halt with the aid of a police vehicle. There was no damage to either vehicle.\u00a0 \u0022The driver arranged for the vehicle to be recovered\u0022.\u00a0 MG Cars Europe was contacted for comment. ",
