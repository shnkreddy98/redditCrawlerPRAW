confining a Grade 8 student in a locker for about two minutes.</p><p>Almost three years after the incident, the student&#x27;s family is still pushing to have the teacher transferred to another school.</p><p>It happened during the lunch hour on December 4, 2020, at the <em>Collège catholique Franco-Ouest</em> in Bells Corners. The boy, then age 12, was joking around with his friends by showing them he could fit in his locker.</p><p>&quot;It was a lot of fun,&quot; he said — until a teacher intervened. He said she asked him to go into the locker again.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;When a teacher tells you what you should do, you do it,&quot; he said in a French interview with Radio-Canada, which agreed to withhold his name because he&#x27;s a minor.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the boy, the teacher shut the locker door and held it closed. He said he repeatedly tried to get out. He also said the door hit him in the face, though it did not cause any injuries.</p><p dir="ltr">Inside, he said he heard laughter as well as comments that he would be inside for several minutes and would be late for his next class. He said the teacher even asked whether anyone had a lock.</p><p dir="ltr">CBC/Radio-Canada has watched surveillance footage of the event obtained by the boy&#x27;s father through a freedom of information request.</p><p dir="ltr">The video shows a woman approach a boy, who then enters the locker. It shows her place her foot against the door of the locker at least four times. The door is seen to open twice, before the boy finally steps out.</p><p dir="ltr">He remains inside the locker for almost two minutes.</p><p dir="ltr"><em><strong>WATCH | Teacher confines student to locker at Ottawa school:</strong></em></p><div dir="ltr"><span class="mediaEmbed"><div class="player-placeholder-ui-container "><div class="player-placeholder-video-ui" title="Teacher confines student to locker at Ottawa school" role="button" tabindex="0"><div class="player-placeholder"></div><div class="player-placeholder-ui "><div class="video-item video-card-overlay " title="Teacher confines student to locker at Ottawa school"><div class="thumbnail-wrapper"><div class="thumbnail-container"><img srcSet="

The Crown can intervene to put an end to the proceedings by requesting a stay.</p><p dir="ltr">On Sept. 20, 2023, the Crown did precisely that in this case, making a stay request that was accepted by the court. It provided no reason during the hearing.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The Crown will suspend or withdraw accusations when there is no perspective of a conviction or when it is not in the public interest to continue,&quot; the Ministry of the Attorney General said in a French-language email.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;In this case, a stay of proceedings was issued after an in-depth examination by the Crown prosecutor.&quot;</p><h2 dir="ltr">Family loses confidence in system</h2><p dir="ltr">Michel and his son felt abandoned by the institutions that examined the case.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I had confidence that the school would do something to protect the victim,&quot; he said in French. &quot;I thought that, because the police confirmed that there was a crime, it would be taken seriously.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">He now believes that the system seems designed to protect teachers more than students.</p><p dir="ltr">Michel repeatedly asked the <em>Collège catholique Franco-Ouest</em> to transfer the teacher to another school until his son finished his studies there. He was also concerned about his daughter, who is now in Grade 7.</p><p dir="ltr">The school board assured him in email exchanges that it would limit contact between the teacher and his son, but Michel said that didn&#x27;t happen. In a new complaint filed with the OCT this month, he alleges that the teacher was in close proximity to his son on seven occasions.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;That reminds me of what happened and it makes me nervous sometimes,&quot; the boy said in French. &quot;There is always a little bit of fear in me.&quot;</p><p>The school board said it is working &quot;in close collaboration with all those implicated and the authorities to ensure the security and well-being of the student.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have even less confidence in my school board,&quot; the boy said, &quot;because they really decided to do nothing.&quot;</p></div></div><div class="source"><p>With files from Radio-Canada&#x27;s Rosalie Sinclair</p></div><div class="contentFeedback-RoTQP contentFeedback-hjGnu"><div class="bottomSeparator-FdM_L"><a href="https://cbc.radio-canada.ca/en/vision/governance/journalistic-standards-and-practices" class="journalistLink-WCERZ">CBC&#x27;s Journalistic Standards and Practices</a><span class="separator-NZujE">|</span><a href="/news/about-cbc-news-1.1294364" class="trustProjectLink-QxM0q">About CBC <!-- -->News</a></div><a class="reportIssue-xC8cZ" href="/news/corrections-clarifications-1.5893564">Corrections and clarifications</a><span class="separator-NZujE">|</span><a class="reportIssue-xC8cZ" href="/news/email-cbc-contact-phone-tips-news-story-1.6466536">Submit a news tip</a><span class="separator-NZujE">|</span><button class="reportIssue-xC8cZ" aria-expanded="false" data-cy="reportIssue">Report error<span class="icon"><span class="icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 10 10" focusable="false" class="chevronIcon down expandIcon" width="10px" height="10px" aria-label="expand" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="M10,0v3L5,7L0,3V0l5,4L10,0z"></path></g></svg></span></span></button><div class="accordionContainer accordionOpen-false"></div></div></div></div><div class="withFlex"><div class="detailSideRail"><div class="stickyContainer stickyRailAd"></div><div class="stickyContainer"><div class="detailDiscovery"><div class="lazy-load"></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="detailBodyContainer"><div class="withFlex"><div class="lazy-load"></div><div class="detailDiscovery"><div class="lazy-load"></div></div><div class="detailDiscovery"></div><div class="detailDiscovery"><div class="lazy-load"></div></div><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"WebPage","speakable":{"@type":"SpeakableSpecification","cssSelector":[".detailHeadline",".detailSummary"]}}</script></div></div></div></main><footer class="globalFooter sclt-footer" aria-label="CBC Footer" data-cy="globalFooter"><div class="footerBody extendedFooter"><h2 class="a11y">Footer Links</h2><div class="footerColumn account"><h3 class="footerHeading">My Account</h3><ul class="footerList"><li class="footerItem"><a class="footerLink" href="/account/login">Profile</a></li><li class="footerItem"><a href="https://gem.cbc.ca/benefits/" class="footerLink" target="_blank">CBC Gem</a></li><li class="footerItem"><a href="https://subscriptions.cbc.ca/listmanagement" class="footerLink" target="_blank">Newsletters</a></li><li class="footerItem"><a class="footerLink" href="/account/features">About CBC Accounts</a></li></ul></div><div class="footerColumn connect"><h3 class="footerHeading">Connect with CBC</h3><ul class="footerList"><li class="footerItem"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/cbc/" class="footerLink" target="_blank">Facebook</a></li><li class="footerItem"><a href="https://twitter.com/cbc/" class="footerLink" target="_blank">Twitter</a></li><li class="footerItem"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CBCtv" class="footerLink" target="_blank">YouTube</a></li><li class="footerItem"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/cbc/?hl=en" class="footerLink" target="_blank">Instagram</a></li><li class="footerItem"><a href="https://cbchelp.cbc.ca/hc/en-ca/categories/115000249853-Help-with-CBC-Apps" class="footerLink" target="_blank">Mobile</a></li><li class="footerItem"><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/rss/" class="footerLink" target="_blank">RSS</a></li><li class="footerItem"><a class="footerLink" href="/radio/podcasts">Podcasts</a></li></ul></div><div class="footerColumn contact"><h3 class="footerHeading">Contact CBC</h3><ul class="footerList"><li class="footerItem"><a href="https://cbchelp.cbc.ca/hc/en-ca/requests/new" class="footerLink" target="_blank">Submit Feedback</a></li><li class="footerItem"><a href="https://cbchelp.cbc.ca/hc/en-ca" class="footerLink" target="_blank">Help Centre</a></li></ul><p>Audience Relations, CBC <br/>P.O.
