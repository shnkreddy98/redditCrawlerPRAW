I had relaxed a bit after the last two national elections, which had seemed to signal a return to normalcy. Donald Trump was decisively defeated in 2020 and, in 2022, most of his fellow election deniers also lost in their bids to take over the election machinery of swing states. But now we’re back in Crazytown. Trump is the almost certain Republican nominee in 2024. And, if current polls are to be believed, he has an excellent chance of winning the presidency again — despite his two impeachments, his incitement of an insurrection, and the 91 felony counts he currently faces in four criminal cases. A year ago, I naively imagined that Trump would be politically hurt by being indicted. Once again, I either overestimated the American public or underestimated Trump. If anything, the criminal cases seem to have helped him politically. He leads all his Republican challengers by a very wide margin: In the FiveThirtyEight polling average, he is at nearly 56 percent among Republican voters. Even more disturbing, Trump is running neck and neck with President Biden in general-election matchups. That means — given the Republican advantage in the electoral college — that he is probably ahead in the electoral count. Somehow, most voters have decided that Biden is too old for the presidency, but Trump, who is only three years younger and infinitely less cogent, isn’t. The prospect of another Trump term is the greatest foreseeable disaster that can befall the United States and the world. Trump is likely to be 10 times more dangerous this time around, because he won’t allow any adults in the White House to act as a check on his worst instincts — no more Jim Mattis as defense secretary, John F. Kelly as chief of staff or H.R. McMaster as national security adviser. In a second term, Trump is likely to only appoint advisers as unhinged as he is. We can only speculate what this will mean, but the likelihood is that Trump will cut off aid to Ukraine, pull out of NATO, eviscerate the civil service and the military’s top ranks, and appoint an attorney general who will prosecute his enemies. For a start. He was eager to do all of those things in his first term but was dissuaded or blocked by the “deep state.” He’s unlikely to allow that to happen again. He has become even more radical and more authoritarian since leaving office, and he now has much more experience in getting what he wants out of the government. The consequences will be dire enough domestically, imperiling U.S. democracy, but they will be even worse internationally. Among other alarming consequences, a Trump presidency could allow Russian leader Vladimir Putin to defeat Ukraine and remake the 21st-century global order in favor of tyrants and aggressors. So how do we stop Trump? Biden is a feeble vessel at best, but he’s the only realistic option we have. It’s true that he is 80 years old (and would be 82 at the start of a new term), and he often stumbles rhetorically and sometimes physically. But his successful performance in office belies his doddering image. He has managed to pass big, bipartisan bills, including infrastructure legislation that Trump only talked about. He has been even more impressive internationally, assembling a large coalition to oppose Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine and another coalition in East Asia to deter China from aggression of its own. The economy — the ultimate barometer of a president’s performance — has been doing much better than expected, with low unemployment, declining inflation and no recession in sight. That’s a record any president can be proud of. Yet the polls haven’t been giving Biden the credit he is due, possibly because perceptions of the economy still lag the reality. In an ideal world, Biden would head off to a well-deserved retirement and a younger, more vigorous successor — someone such as Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, California Gov. Gavin Newsom or Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo — would run in his place. The likelihood is that any of those candidates would be stronger than Biden in the general election.  But we don’t live in that ideal world. In the world as it is, we’re just a few months before the start of the primaries, so if Biden were to step down now, the almost certain Democratic nominee would be Vice President Harris. (The last sitting vice president who sought but failed to secure a party’s presidential nomination was Alben Barkley in 1952.) And I have yet to meet a Democrat who has any confidence in  Harris’s ability to beat Trump. Harris has a poor track record in national politics. She exited the 2020 Democratic race before a single vote was cast and has done little to elevate herself as vice president (admittedly a difficult task in a low-profile post with few fixed responsibilities). Moreover, unfair as it is, there is good cause to worry that Trump would run a sexist and racist campaign that could hurt Harris among working-class White voters in industrial states. The RealClearPolitics polling average shows that, while Trump is beating Biden by just 0.5 points, he leads Harris by 4 points — and that’s before he has begun to focus his fire and fury on her. At the same time, any move to challenge Biden in the primaries or to replace Harris on the ticket would lead to Democratic fratricide which would likely ease Trump’s path back to power. Anyone who believes in preserving American democracy and the U.S.-led world order, therefore, has no choice but to back Biden in 2024, however uninspiring that might be. We had better hope that popular perceptions of the economy improve … and that a likely Trump conviction might dissuade swing voters from supporting him … and that a third-party candidate won’t split the anti-Trump vote … and that Biden doesn’t experience any Mitch McConnell-like freeze-ups or other health scares. Otherwise, come November 2024, we might be facing the end of the world as we know it. You can see why I’m not feeling good about the future — not when the fate of the world depends on the vitality and vigor of an octogenarian who looks his age. But it does."},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LDUSQDWVAEI6XJJ2HNKFB7OKPI_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200"}}</script><link rel="canonical" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/09/25/biden-realistic-trump-alternative-democracy/"/><link hrefLang="en" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com"/><link rel="preload" as="image" imageSrcSet="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LDUSQDWVAEI6XJJ2HNKFB7OKPI_size-normalized.jpg&amp;w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LDUSQDWVAEI6XJJ2HNKFB7OKPI_size-normalized.jpg&amp;w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LDUSQDWVAEI6XJJ2HNKFB7OKPI_size-normalized.jpg&amp;w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LDUSQDWVAEI6XJJ2HNKFB7OKPI_size-normalized.jpg&amp;w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LDUSQDWVAEI6XJJ2HNKFB7OKPI_size-normalized.jpg&amp;w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LDUSQDWVAEI6XJJ2HNKFB7OKPI_size-normalized.jpg&amp;w=1200 1200w" imageSizes="(max-width: 440px) 440px,(max-width: 600px) 691px,(max-width: 768px) 691px,(min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 1023px) 960px,(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1299px) 530px,(min-width: 1300px) and (max-width: 1439px) 691px,(min-width: 1440px) 916px,440px"/><link rel="preload" as="font" crossorigin="crossorigin" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-stat/assets/fonts/PostoniWide-Bold.woff2"/><link rel="preload" as="font" crossorigin="crossorigin" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-stat/assets/fonts/ITC_Franklin-Bold.woff2"/><link rel="preload" as="font" crossorigin="crossorigin" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-stat/assets/fonts/ITC_Franklin-Light.woff2"/><script>window.wpAdFusion = {"author":["Max Boot"],"commercialNode":"/opinions/columns","contentType":"article","domain":"https://www.washingtonpost.com","firstPubDate":"2023-09-25T09:45:08.145Z","keywords":["partner-exclude"],"pageId":"2O2GH7JVYFEM3CKGBSOTAEW3EI","contextualTargeting":{"adcall":[{"key":"ca","values":["rcisc","r1zb8","rjqr5","rnfyo","r71he","rqlce","rqrfm","r63ky","rq0bc","r8kl5","r1djc","rj98c","rrcyg","r2ztd","rp6mz","ralq3","rzhm0","rh5hz","rsvk8","r2lez","r0yv2","rcvrb","rpkxx","rohf5","reest","rvrh1","r8paa","rqltv","r6ovq","ru0hj","rk4hi","r2ob4","riure","r2x7m","rihsc","r4qca","rmmp3","ren01","rpnzx","r8pmm","rbxhu","rw76f","r6iq7","rgdkb","rh22v","rhwg4","r82mu","r35cx","r4t03","rpz02","rl43b","ru1jm","r6jbe","ryx8n","rkgjf","raw34","r6g4r","rxd3z","rf299","rvqcm","rzhau","r02mg","rzd33","rxa9g","rtdlb","rjuyh","rzfmu","r35ap","r23bw","rloxr","rz25l","r3hdp","rynal","rmoni","rrytf","r7d9r","rl7yb","rsmxd","rix28","rp9h4","r7tmu","rzqdp","rva7x","r4avn","rdj51","r3bxp","rabwy","r3lhr","rwsk4","rfhup","ryiv4","r3ykj","rsjjy","rhfzk","rqs5o","r4t4y","r35lh","rr25v","rfpua","rj2ns","rfz4c","rj67t","r8hz2","rd7v3","r2qxu","raoi5","rk7m0","rh5xk","ra7me","r1fne","rayex","ratb5","r5hej","rhll0","rtbcp","rnfuc","r8x1i","rg5cq","rx8m9","r4vlh","rl3n6","rbtz1","ridxr","rd18m","r2hzw","r1ysy","r8ig8","rx4px","r69iu","rf3q1","r78zx","rs7c2","rsoqi","rjvyd","rsesv","rxeck","rcase","rlz8o","r135d","rzofg","rwlm1","r46n5","r5lck","rvhux","rglme","rdlnx","rg1ny","r1fsz","rc6uk","rs1ox","r301t","rf0ll"]},{"key":"wapoTopics","values":["x2ec","eleu","ganp"]}],"permutive":[{"key":"article.customTopics","values":["[rvrh1] Donald Trump","[r4t03] World National Local Content","[rxd3z] B2_Cyber Security & Intelligence Community_legacyaux_E8X","[r23bw] B2_Government & Policy_legacyaux_mza","[rmoni] Racing and Nascar Enthusiasts","[rdj51] B2_Politically Active -
