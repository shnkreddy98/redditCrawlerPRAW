Here’s a summary of today’s main events:An Israeli strike on a medical convoy near Al-Shifa Hospital that killed 15 people was just one of three attacks near a medical facility in Gaza City today, according to local health authorities.Israel says its military targeted an ambulance being used by Hamas fighters near Al-Shifa.Palestinian Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra rejected that claim, saying two ambulance vehicles were struck and that the convoy was transporting patients.Separate Israeli strikes in the north of Gaza also targeted a convoy of civilians seeking to evacuate via the al-Rashid road, killing at least 14; At least 20 were killed in an Israeli attack on a school hosting displaced people in the Saftawi neighbourhood.Amid the violence, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees has said it can no longer provide safety at shelters under the UN flag; UNRWA also said at least 38 people have died in UN facilities since the war began, with five facilities directly hit in bombardments.Top US diplomat Antony Blinken has said he stressed the need for “concrete” steps to protect civilians during meetings with Israeli leaders in Tel Aviv.Immediately after meeting the US secretary of state, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu ruled out a temporary ceasefire despite growing pressure for “humanitarian pauses”, including from Washington.Breaking his silence for the first time since the war began, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in a speech said those who want to prevent a regional escalation must stop the war on the Gaza Strip.Nasrallah added that the Lebanon-based group is ready for all possibilities, as firings across the Israel-Lebanon border continued.More people have been able to leave Gaza via the Rafah crossing with Egypt, including family members of Scotland’s first minister Humza Yousaf.","keywords":"News, Israel, Middle East, Palestine, Gaza, Hamas, Israel-Palestine conflict"}]}</script><script data-rh="true" type="application/ld+json"

Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has released a statement on today’s attack on the medical convoy in Gaza City.Here’s what it said:Around 4:05pm local time, a convoy of ambulances left the Al-Shifa Hospital in a decision that was coordinated with the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza.The convoy, which was headed towards the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, included five ambulance vehicles: four belonged to the Health Ministry and one belonged to PRCS.The convoy travelled about four kilometres from the hospital to the al-Rashid coastal road, but found it was impassible due to rubble and rocks resulting from shelling in the area.The vehicles returned towards the Al-Shifa Hospital; When they were about one kilometre from the facility, the first ambulance at the head of the convoy – which belonged to the Health Ministry – was “directly targeted by a missile”.The other vehicles continued towards the hospital. When the PRCS ambulance reached the gate of the Al-Shifa Hospital, it was “struck by a missile fired by the Israeli forces”.This attack on the PRCS ambulance killed 15 people and injured more than 60 others at the hospital’s entrance.Eight Red Crescent ambulances have been “rendered inoperable due to Israeli targeting” since the war in Gaza began, the statement said.“PRCS emphasizes that the deliberate targeting of medical teams constitutes a grave violation of the Geneva Conventions, a war crime,” it said.🔴 PRCS Statement on The Israeli Occupation Forces shelling of the Ambulance Convoy transporting the injured from the aggression on #Gaza towards Rafah crossing border on November 3rd 2023. pic.twitter.com/pzVEMeOo23— PRCS (@PalestineRCS) November 3, 2023","keywords":"News, Israel, Middle East, Palestine, Gaza, Hamas, Israel-Palestine conflict"}]}</script><script data-rh="true" type="application/ld+json" data-reactroot="">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"LiveBlogPosting","@id":"#2458259","liveBlogUpdate":[{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Al Jazeera","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/images/logo_aje.png","width":224,"height":291}},"headline":"Despite deadlock, some hope UN Security Council can pass long-sought Gaza resolution","datePublished":"2023-11-03T22:50:19Z","dateModified":"2023-11-03T23:01:13Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kristen Saloomey","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/author/kristen_saloomey_2013115201158470998"},"url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/11/3/israel-hamas-war-live-israeli-forces-gather-outside-gaza-city?utm_source=google&utm_medium=live-blog-schema","mainEntityOfPage":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/11/3/israel-hamas-war-live-israeli-forces-gather-outside-gaza-city?utm_source=google&utm_medium=live-blog-schema","articleBody":"The 10 elected countries on the UN Security Council say they haven’t given up on the possibility of the council acting, and they have been working on yet another draft resolution.This would be the fifth one to go to a vote before the council, but a vote has yet to be scheduled.We do know that the Security Council is holding special meetings this week.

Perhaps an agreement to allow fuel into Gaza, or a reduction in air attacks that lead to civilian casualties – maybe even one of the “humanitarian pauses” that the US administration has pushed over the last week.Indeed, after his meeting with Netanyahu, Blinken said that more needed to be done to protect Palestinian civilians and that they should not “suffer the consequences for [Hamas’s] inhumanity”.Blinken even appeared to hint at a more robust tone being adopted with the Israelis, and that more pressure had been put on them.If Israel’s actions in Gaza today were a response to Blinken’s visit, then the message is obvious.Israel hit an ambulance convoy outside a hospital – at least 15 were reported killed, amid horrific scenes. At least 14 were killed in an attack on Palestinians fleeing south on what the Israelis have termed ‘safe routes’, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health. And at least 20 died in an attack on a school providing shelter for the displaced, also according to the ministry.Whether Blinken is in town or not, the Israelis have made it clear: Their tactics aren’t changing, no matter how many civilians are killed.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken sits onboard the plane during his visit to Israel as he departs en route to Jordan, in Tel Aviv, Israel November 3, 2023.

after Israel revoked their permits,” she said.“There are worrying reports that some are being sent back into Gaza, despite the gravity of the situation there,” Throssell added.“We don’t know exactly

People are now standing on the rubble, picking at the ground with their bare hands, trying to get their loved ones out – even if there is most likely no one still alive under the collapsed buildings.Al Jazeera’s Hisham Zaqout said that 10 Israeli missiles landed on the camp on Thursday, in an attack that killed at least 15 people, according to Gaza’s Civil Defence. Based on the number of Palestinians searching for people under the rubble, the true death toll is expected to be higher.Locals described the strikes to Zaqout as turning everything dark, leaving them unable to see those around them or assess the damage visually.Palestinians look for survivors in the rubble of a destroyed building following an Israeli airstrike in Bureij refugee camp in the Gaza Strip on Thursday, November 2 [Hassan Eslaiah/AP Photo]“An earthquake is not as bad as this,” one man told Zaqout. “If you were here, you died. If you were 200, 300 metres away, you also died. What happened is not normal. This wasn’t an earthquake.”“These missiles are fired on civilians. We hear a phrase a lot in the media: ‘prohibited by international law’. Can no country in the world look at the Palestinian people?” the man added. “We’re not an advanced country for them to hit us like this. Can no Arab country even look at us with mercy?”Zaqout picked through pictures and notebooks that now sit on the destroyed buildings. “There were families here, but now they’re under the rubble,” he said, as those around him picked at what was left of the buildings with their hands.One man said he was looking for his sister and her daughter. Another, sat squatting on the rubble, appeared resigned.“[I’m looking for] my two sisters and their daughters. We’re just sitting here watching and hoping for relief from God. They’re gone now. They’re martyrs, thank God.”A Palestinian man holds the remains of his mother wrapped in a blanket amid the rubble of a building destroyed in an Israeli strike on the Bureij refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip on November 2, 2023 [Mahmud Hams/AFP]","keywords":"News, Israel, Middle East, Palestine, Gaza, Hamas, Israel-Palestine conflict"}]}</script><script data-rh="true" type="application/ld+json" data-reactroot="">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"LiveBlogPosting","@id":"#2458259","liveBlogUpdate":[{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Al Jazeera","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/images/logo_aje.png","width":224,"height":291}},"headline":"Palestinian death toll in Jenin rises to four as a result of Israeli attack","datePublished":"2023-11-03T02:22:00Z","dateModified":"2023-11-03T02:47:16Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Bernard Smith","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/author/bernard_smith_201210210562877344"},"url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/11/3/israel-hamas-war-live-israeli-forces-gather-outside-gaza-city?utm_source=google&utm_medium=live-blog-schema","mainEntityOfPage":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/11/3/israel-hamas-war-live-israeli-forces-gather-outside-gaza-city?utm_source=google&utm_medium=live-blog-schema","articleBody":"Four people have now been killed in this operation.

reasoning for its acceptance of such a large civilian death toll from its bombing of Gaza is a result of its failure to heavily damage Hamas’s military capabilities, despite a month of bombardment, says Middle East researcher Mouin Rabbani.“When you’re faced with incapable ground forces who are unable to meet the objectives that you have set out for them, then you turn this territory into a killing field, and engaging in these mass killings, not as a prelude to a successful ground operation, but in large part as an alternative to it,” Rabbani says of the Israeli state’s mentality.“You have this staggering body count … and thereby satisfy your blood lust and desire for revenge, and can present this as an achievement to your constituents and public opinion,” Rabbani added. “And I think there may be a realisation already among the Israeli leadership that they’re not going to achieve their objectives, and that they will then say, well we razed the Gaza Strip to the ground, we killed thousands upon thousands of people, we imposed a medieval siege on them, don’t tell us we didn’t achieve anything.”","keywords":"News, Israel, Middle East, Palestine, Gaza, Hamas,

in the occupied West Bank before dawn on Friday.According to the post, residents of a residential building near the city of Nablus were “forcefully” removed from their homes, as Israeli forces threatened to demolish their building.Al Jazeera also received reports that Israeli forces also surrounded a house in the Jabriyat neighbourhood near the Jenin refugee camp, demanding its evacuation and threatening to blow up the building.Israeli forces carried out on Friday new raids across the occupied West Bank – operations that have become a nightly occurrence.قوات الاحتلال الإسرائيلي تقتحم

a recap of what happened today at the Republican-controlled US House of Representatives:Voting 226 to 196, largely along party lines, the Republicans passed a plan introduced by new House Speaker Mike Johnson to provide $14.3bn in aid to Israel as it fights Hamas.The Republican plan provides billions for Israel’s military, including $4bn for procurement of Israel’s Iron Dome and David’s Sling defence systems to counter short-range rocket threats.The Republicans rejected a much larger emergency spending bill worth $106bn offered by US President Joe Biden, which also covers military aid to Ukraine and Taiwan as well as humanitarian aid.The bill will most likely be dead on arrival, as Biden had threatened a veto. The Democrat-controlled Senate also said that it would not bring it up for a vote.Republicans have a 221-212 majority in the House, but Biden’s fellow Democrats control the Senate 51-49.House Republican leaders said they would cover the cost of the aid to Israel by cutting some funding for the Internal Revenue Service – a proposal Democrats describe as a “poison pill”.According to estimates by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, IRS cuts and Israel aid in the standalone bill would add nearly $30bn to the US budget deficit, currently estimated at $1.7 trillion.Democratic Representative Rosa DeLauro said the Republican plan “abandons Ukraine” while adding that the fortunes of Israel and Ukraine “are linked”.Speaker Johnson, who voted against Ukraine aid repeatedly, said that a separate bill on Ukraine aid “will come next”.","keywords":"News, Israel, Middle East, Palestine, Gaza, Hamas, Israel-Palestine conflict"}]}</script><script data-rh="true" type="application/ld+json" data-reactroot="">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"LiveBlogPosting","@id":"#2458259","liveBlogUpdate":[{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Al Jazeera","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/images/logo_aje.png","width":224,"height":291}},"headline":"Hezbollah, Israel exchange fire ahead of Nasrallah speech on Friday","datePublished":"2023-11-03T00:15:36Z","dateModified":"2023-11-02T23:59:45Z","author":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Al Jazeera"},"url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/11/3/israel-hamas-war-live-israeli-forces-gather-outside-gaza-city?utm_source=google&utm_medium=live-blog-schema","mainEntityOfPage":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/11/3/israel-hamas-war-live-israeli-forces-gather-outside-gaza-city?utm_source=google&utm_medium=live-blog-schema","articleBody":"Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Israel have exchanged fire over the last few hours ahead of the expected address of the Shia group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, on Friday – his first since the Israel-Hamas war began on October 7.In a statement, the Israeli military said that it struck “a series of Hezbollah terrorist targets in Lebanon” on Thursday.Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging deadly fire across the Israel-Lebanese border since Hamas launched an attack on Israel on October 7.

The [Israeli army] is doing everything in its power to achieve this”.Shortly afterwards, Hamas’s military wing, the Qassam Brigades, said Gaza would be a “curse” for Israel and that its invading

Here’s a summary of today’s main events:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Israeli strike on a <a href="/news/2023/11/3/several-killled-in-israeli-attack-on-ambulance-convoy-gaza-health-ministry">medical convoy</a> near Al-Shifa Hospital that killed 15 people was just one of three attacks near a medical facility in Gaza City today, according to local health authorities.</li>
<li>Israel says its military targeted an ambulance being used by Hamas fighters near Al-Shifa.</li>
<li>Palestinian Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra rejected that claim, saying two ambulance vehicles were struck and that the convoy was transporting patients.</li>
<li>Separate Israeli strikes in the north of Gaza also targeted a convoy of civilians seeking to evacuate via the al-Rashid road, killing at least 14; At least 20 were killed in an Israeli attack on a school hosting displaced people in the Saftawi neighbourhood.</li>
<li>Amid the violence, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees has said it can no longer provide safety at shelters under the UN flag; UNRWA also said at least 38 people have died in UN facilities since the war began, with five facilities directly hit in bombardments.</li>
<li>Top US diplomat <a href="/news/2023/11/3/blinken-discusses-humanitarian-pauses-as-israel-encircles-gaza-city">Antony Blinken</a> has said he stressed the need for “concrete” steps to protect civilians during meetings with Israeli leaders in Tel Aviv.</li>
<li>Immediately after meeting the US secretary of state, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu ruled out a temporary ceasefire despite growing pressure for “humanitarian pauses”, including from Washington.</li>
<li>Breaking his silence for the first time since the war began, <a href="/news/2023/11/3/relief-in-lebanon-as-hezbollahs-nasrallah-holds-off-on-wider-israel-war">Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah</a> in a speech said those who want to prevent a regional escalation must stop the war on the Gaza Strip.</li>
<li>Nasrallah added that the Lebanon-based group is ready for all possibilities, as firings across the Israel-Lebanon border continued.</li>
<li>More people have been able to leave Gaza via the Rafah crossing with Egypt, including family members of Scotland’s first minister Humza Yousaf.</li>

<p>Here’s what it said:</p>
<ul>
<li>Around 4:05pm local time, a convoy of ambulances left the Al-Shifa Hospital in a decision that was coordinated with the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza.</li>
<li>The convoy, which was headed towards the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, included five ambulance vehicles: four belonged to the Health Ministry and one belonged to PRCS.</li>
<li>The convoy travelled about four kilometres from the hospital to the al-Rashid coastal road, but found it was impassible due to rubble and rocks resulting from shelling in the area.</li>
<li>The vehicles returned towards the Al-Shifa Hospital; When they were about one kilometre from the facility, the first ambulance at the head of the convoy – which belonged to the Health Ministry – was “directly targeted by a missile”.</li>
<li>The other vehicles continued towards the hospital. When the PRCS ambulance reached the gate of the Al-Shifa Hospital, it was “struck by a missile fired by the Israeli forces”.</li>
<li>This attack on the PRCS ambulance killed 15 people and injured more than 60 others at the hospital’s entrance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eight Red Crescent ambulances have been “rendered inoperable due to Israeli targeting” since the war in Gaza began, the statement said.</p>
<p>“PRCS emphasizes that the deliberate targeting of medical teams constitutes a grave violation of the Geneva Conventions, a war crime,” it said.</p>

<p>We do know that the Security Council is holding special meetings this week. They’ve been having an off-site retreat to welcome new elected members of the council who will be joining in the new year.</p>
<p>There’s some hope from UN officials that we’ve spoken to that this grouping will encourage discussion and compromise and that maybe the council will finally be able to come together given the gravity of the situation and speak with one voice.</p>

<p>The activists “were arrested after engaging in civil disobedience in defense of the human rights of the Palestinian people”, the group’s executive director, Ahmad Abuznaid, said in a post on social media.</p>
<p>“The US government is arresting human rights defenders protesting genocide while arming the war criminals.”</p>

Perhaps an agreement to allow fuel into Gaza, or a reduction in air attacks that lead to civilian casualties – maybe even one of the “humanitarian pauses” that the US administration has pushed over the last week.</p>
<p>Indeed, after his meeting with Netanyahu, Blinken said that more needed to be done to protect Palestinian civilians and that they should not “suffer the consequences for [Hamas’s] inhumanity”.</p>
<p>Blinken even appeared to hint at a more robust tone being adopted with the Israelis, and that more pressure had been put on them.</p>
<p>If Israel’s actions in Gaza today were a response to Blinken’s visit, then the message is obvious.</p>
<p>Israel hit an <a href="/news/2023/11/3/several-killled-in-israeli-attack-on-ambulance-convoy-gaza-health-ministry">ambulance convoy</a> outside a hospital – at least 15 were reported killed, amid horrific scenes. At least 14 were killed in an attack on Palestinians fleeing south on what the Israelis have termed ‘safe routes’, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health. And at least 20 died in an attack on a school providing shelter for the displaced, also according to the ministry.</p>
<p>Whether Blinken is in town or not, the Israelis have made it clear: Their tactics aren’t changing, no matter how many civilians are killed.</p>

<p>“If indeed they suspect that an entire hospital staff is complicit in the smuggling of – to use Israel’s word – ‘terrorists’ into the southern part of Gaza, then Israel should show some proof of that,” Bishara said.</p>
<p>Bishara also questioned what this Israeli attack means moving forward in Gaza.</p>
<p>“Does this really mean that Israel now is going to bomb every possible ambulance because it suspects there are Hamas fighters in it?” he asked. “So it’s going to be bombing, what? More hospitals? More ambulances? More schools? More churches?”</p>

<p>“The Red Cross told us and informed us in a very frank way that Israel is rejecting [forms of] coordination for all the humanitarian missions,” al-Qudra said at a news conference outside al-Shifa.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, with hospitals overrun with patients they are unable to treat and some patients approved to cross into Egypt for treatment, the spokesperson said it was decided “to send those ambulance vehicles that would leave or depart from the medical complex from the south at 4pm [14:00 GMT]”.</p>
<p>“Before the vehicles departed, we have informed everyone through a press conference and we have also been in touch with … the Red Cross and also the United Nations agencies to inform them,” al-Qudra said.</p>

<p>There’s another team which is Nasrallah’s supporter base. They are going to accept Nasrallah, whatever he says.</p>
<p>And there’s a third team, which is the team that is concerned about the war. It doesn’t want to see Lebanon getting into this war. Some of them are kind of relieved.

<li>Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) spokesman Mohamed Abu Musbah said the entrance to the hospital was “filled with civilians” when the attack took place.</li>
<li>An ambulance driver and PRCS staff member survived but one suffered shrapnel wounds in the leg, Abu Musbah said; A female patient being transported in an ambulance was also wounded and in “serious condition”.</li>

<li>Al Jazeera footage from the scene showed people frantically combing through the rubble, using their phones as torches.</li>
<li>Large plumes of smoke could be seen in the evening sky as small fires had broken out amid the mounds of debris.</li>
<li>The hospital’s main generator stopped 48 hours ago, the facility’s director, Atef al-Kahlout said.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Al-Quds Hospital</strong></p>

<p class="x_paragraph">Oxfam said Israeli forces have a “near-complete stranglehold on Gaza City and the northern region, effectively cutting the enclave in half from the border wall to the sea”.</p>
<p>“We are sharing resources with 10 other families. The markets [are] almost empty,” Oxfam humanitarian worker Alhasan Swairjo said in a voice-note from Gaza City shared by the group.</p>
<p>“There’s no fresh food across all the city. We depend on canned food. The bread markets have no electricity and only a limited amount of fuel – one day, two days, five days, we don’t know,” Swairjo said.</p>
<p>“We are making bread at home but don’t know in [the] next few days if we will have enough cooking gas. Our children are suffering, they don’t understand why we moved, why Israel is shooting us. We cannot give a good explanation why all this is happening. Now we’re fighting to survive, our children are fighting to survive.”</p>

<p>The Palestinian Authority would be present, but Israel was not set to be invited, the diplomats said.</p>

<p>“The claims by the Israelis over the past two decades about Palestinian misuse of medical resources for the resistance have been thoroughly debunked. It was really concerning when the exact same <a href="/news/2023/10/27/hamas-rejects-israeli-claim-over-installations-under-al-shifa-hospital">accusations were raised again</a> recently, most notably against Shifa,” Loubani said.</p>
<p>“What it felt like to me was that they were creating the pretext; that pretext has predictable consequences,” he told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>“The Israeli forces know that people do not accept attacks on health facilities, and for some reason, the Israeli forces are trying to legitimise attacking healthcare workers, healthcare infrastructure and … hospitals.”</p>
<p>Loubani added that he was “absolutely horrified” to see today’s attacks on hospitals and healthcare workers.</p>
<p>“No healthcare facility should ever be targeted directly or indirectly, and no healthcare infrastructure should ever be targeted directly or indirectly. Healthcare workers are dying, paramedics are dying, hospitals are getting bombed,” he said.</p>
<p>“My demand and what I think we should all demand is that the Israelis honour the sanctity of hospitals, the sanctity of the healthcare system, so that whatever else happens, there’s at least one place that remains safe.”</p>

<p>He spoke to Al Jazeera after health workers and Gaza officials said an ambulance convoy leaving al-Shifa Hospital was attacked by Israeli forces.</p>
<p>“I’ve been in convoys going from al-Shifa down to Rafah [crossing] to go to Egypt with wounded and I have experienced that, despite being coordinated with International Red Cross and having escort cars in front and back, we were shot at and had to return,” said Gilbert, who was in Gaza during Israeli bombardments in 2006, 2009, 2012 and 2014.</p>
<p>“So it’s a very scary experience to have the responsibility of a patient maybe intubated, maybe on a ventilator, severely wounded and you go there and you feel quite naked and you hope that the international decency and regulations will protect you,” he said. “Not so in Gaza, not so with Palestinian ambulances. We’ve seen this many times,” he added.</p>
<p>“This is the last in a long line of extremely, extremely cynical and brutal attacks by the Israeli army on patients, on health personnel, on ambulances and on hospitals,” he said.</p>

<p>Like the few other hospitals that remain functional in the besieged territory amid Israel’s relentless bombardment, al-Shifa is overcrowded and facing a severe shortage of medical supplies.</p>
<p>Last month, Al Jazeera’s Youmna ElSayed filed this exclusive report from inside the hospital. Watch it below:</p>

<p>“But he [outlined] two red lines for that, which is one, the development on the ground in Gaza and this is linked, in my own analysis, to the possibility to the fall of Hamas, where he would join [the war].</p>
<p>“And [second] what he called the Israeli behaviour towards Lebanon, which could also be another reason why he could join the war at a higher level,” Fraihat told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:22px">“The important point that he mentioned here is that he already joined the war, that Hezbollah joined the war on October 8. What </span>we’re talking about [now] is the level of involvement.”</p>
<p>Fraihat added that within Nasrallah’s speech is a “very serious message” that if those two red lines are crossed “this war could escalate and expand to a regional war”.</p>

<p>Antony Blinken did dress it up by saying we still need to work out the “where, how and when” this will happen. But almost immediately, Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to the media to say that they will continue with their operation full force.</p>
<p>There will be no ceasefires of any kind until they start releasing captives, [Netanyahu said].</p>
<p>Now, Antony Blinken did say that this humanitarian pause could be linked to the release of captives, but there seems to be a lot of work to be done before that even comes close to being able to be delivered.</p>
<p>He also talked about the need for Israel to work within humanitarian law and the rules of war; It seems as if he’s putting a bit of pressure on them from the language that he used.</p>
<p>When Blinken says “We discussed in the way that only friends can”, it suggests that diplomatically, that means there were a few harsh words. Antony Blinken will be aware that there is growing concern at the pictures constantly being seen out of Gaza, including the pictures we’ve seen just in this hour alone, and the reaction it’s having elsewhere.</p>
<p>Certainly, he has talked about how Israel may start to lose public opinion, not just around the world, but in the US, as well, if those pictures continue, and the death toll continues to rise.</p>

<p>It is the largest hospital in Gaza City and the Gaza Strip, but this is not the only attack.</p>

<p>We still don’t have any news about the ambulance that got targeted, but we know from local sources at al-Shifa Hospital that it happened just after the strike at the front gate.</p>

All my father knew was living here. I don’t know what it is like to live anywhere else.”</p>
<p>This week, al-Hadhrat’s village of shepherds, Khirbet Zanuta, joined the growing swell of Palestinian Bedouin villages forcibly emptied since October 7 due to violent attacks from armed Israeli settlers often wearing Israeli military uniforms.</p>
<p>Khirbet Zanuta is located in the South Hebron Hills region in Area C of the occupied West Bank, which is under full Israeli military control. The founding of Meitarim Farm, an Israeli outpost located 100 metres away on the next hill, in 2021 had made life hard for the community, according to residents.</p>

<p>Lebanon has been on edge ahead of Hassan Nasrallah’s first public address since the war began, which residents and experts fear could inflame regional tensions if he pledges to escalate attacks against Israel.</p>
<p>“Even among [Nasrallah’s] supporters, there are people who feel that [the south] always fought Israel [in the past] and that right now … we’re <a href="/news/2023/10/30/lebanon-fears-regional-war-as-hezbollah-israel-fighting-intensifies">not ready for war</a>,” said Mohamad, a resident from southern Lebanon.</p>
<p>Analysts, meanwhile, say Nasrallah could warn Israel to reconsider its objective.</p>
<p>“I believe Hezbollah … views this conflict as an existential one,” said Mohanad Hage Ali, an expert on Lebanon with the Carnegie Middle East Center. “They think that if Israel manages to meet its objectives in eradicating Hamas in the Gaza Strip, then they will turn around and deal with what they see as the Hezbollah threat.”</p>

<p>“I understand that among these people who are being sent back are those Palestinian workers and hospital patients who had been detained in the aftermath of October 7,” spokeswoman Elizabeth Throssell told reporters in Geneva.</p>
<p>“We were very concerned that at least 4,000 Palestinian workers and hospital patients were detained without sufficient legal basis in military facilities after Israel revoked their permits,” she said.</p>
<p>“There are worrying reports that some are being sent back into Gaza, despite the gravity of the situation there,” Throssell added.</p>
<p>“We don’t know exactly to where; it probably isn’t clear whether they have got even a home to go to; and it’s an incredibly difficult and dangerous situation.”</p>

<p>There’s an ongoing campaign of relentless bombardment across the Gaza Strip. If it gets quiet, it’s only quiet for a few minutes.</p>
<p>We need to take the northern part of Gaza out of this humanitarian equation due to the precondition by the Israeli army that none of the aid should go to the north as it is a military closed zone. And as things get more intense in Gaza, it’s more unlikely that any of these aid trucks will make their way there.</p>
<p>We spoke to some of the people who risked their lives and moved to the south, and they said that for the past few days, they haven’t eaten or drunk anything. It doesn’t matter how many trucks have been allowed into Gaza, it still not covering five 5 percent of the daily needs of Palestinians.</p>

<p>“The political aim, at the end of the day, is to relocate and force the civilians to leave the north to the south. But it is too early to talk this about because we have seen very stiff resistance from Palestinian resistance groups and many casualties from the Israeli soldiers.</p>

<p>So people are very much afraid to go out but there have been attempts by civilian cars in light of the heavy bombardment to try to evacuate to the south.</p>
<p>But every single time for the past four days, we have seen civilian cars including ambulances being targeted, shot at, on al-Rashid street.</p>
<p>This is the only street leading to the south that’s available for cars to take after Israeli tanks infiltrated Salah al-Din and took it over. So people are not able to go out because they are either being shot at or facing the threat of being targeted.</p>

<p>“We don’t know how many were being detained by Israel and how many people have been released into the Strip but this appears to be the beginning of the implementation of [the Israeli cabinet’s] decision,” she said, referring to Friday’s announcement.</p>
<p>Marmur said the group did not have information about the conditions the workers were being held but a few testimonies taken by HaMoked from people who were released because they were residents of the West Bank, instead of Gaza, showed that there was “indication of very bad conditions, they are being subjected to physical abuse as well as psychological abuse and inhumane conditions”.</p>

<p>In it, it says that human rights groups including Gisha and HaMoked had previously submitted “letters, petitions and individual inquiries to Israeli authorities regarding hundreds of Gaza residents, including both workers and people who had entered Israel with permits to receive medical treatment, who were present in Israel on October 7 and had since been unlawfully, secretly detained by Israeli authorities”.</p>
<p>The organisation said the workers were being held by Israel in at least two facilities on Israeli military bases in the occupied West Bank against their will, cut off from the world and without access to legal representation, deprived of their right to due process.</p>
<p>“Israel refused to disclose the names and whereabouts of all the people it was holding, as well as the legal grounds for their detention. We have reason to believe that the holding conditions in these facilities were extremely dire, and that detainees were subjected to extensive physical violence and psychological abuse, as well as being held in inhumane conditions,” the statement said.</p>

<p>When the war started on October 7, they were trapped and couldn’t get back.</p>
<p>Instead, they were rounded up – not just in Israel itself but also in the occupied West Bank – and they were essentially put into camps where they were held.</p>
<p>There were complaints from human rights groups that this was illegal and that these people were not allowed to contact their families; in fact, no one knew exactly where they were.</p>
<p>The groups went to an Israeli court and just in the last few hours, Israel has started to free some of them. About 3,200 are believed to have been taken to one of the crossings with southern Gaza and told to go back into Gaza.</p>
<p>Of course, many human rights organisations are saying that while the circumstance of them being held was illegal, sending them back to Gaza could well end up being a death sentence.</p>

<p>Hezbollah emerged in the wake of Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982 to fight back against Israel’s occupation of southern Lebanon. The Iran-backed Shia armed and political group is one of Israel’s biggest adversaries in the region.</p>
<p>In 2000, Israel withdrew its forces from southern Lebanon after nearly 20 years of fighting, leaving Hezbollah to proclaim itself the first Arab army to force Israel to surrender territory.</p>
<p>Since then, the group has been one of the most influential political blocs in Lebanon. Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said in 2021 that the group had 100,000 fighters and the military capabilities that could hit all parts of Israel.</p>
<p>Since the October 7 surprise attack from Hamas, Hezbollah has repeatedly said it would be monitoring the situation and would only get involved if it felt it needed to.</p>

<p>Many people have been worried that he will declare an all-out war, but in many ways, there is already a war. The group has lost more than 50 men, and they have been launching attacks daily.</p>
<p>What we could possibly hear from the secretary general of Hezbollah is him setting the tone of the trajectory of the conflict. We’ve known Hezbollah’s position from day one, and they’ve made it very clear that Gaza will not fall. They’ve also made it very clear that they’re ready to get more involved in this conflict if they feel there is a need.</p>
<p>But if you talk to Hezbollah officials, they say Hamas is still in a good position and that it doesn’t need their help.</p>

The Jerusalem-born and bred paratrooper served in the occupied West Bank for two years, and for a third year was stationed at Israel’s border with Lebanon.</p>
<p>Now 41, Shaul is a co-founder of the Israeli NGO Breaking the Silence, the first such organisation of Israeli military veterans calling for an end to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>It was during his time stationed at the border with Lebanon that Shaul was first told about <a href="/program/featured-documentaries/2016/10/7/the-hannibal-directive">the Hannibal Directive</a>, a former controversial Israeli military policy aimed at preventing the capture of Israeli soldiers by enemy forces – at any cost.</p>

<p>“A family of a journalist told us they knew he entered Israel on October 7, but they didn’t know what happened to him; they think they saw him in a picture where he was rounded up with others,” said Al Jazeera’s Sara Khairat, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>“From within Gaza, our colleagues say thousands of people, including some injured, have crossed and are now inside the Strip – but they were effectively dumped there,” Khairat said, adding that Israeli authorities may have been forced to send back the workers due to pressure from human rights groups.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="/news/2023/10/28/thousands-of-gaza-workers-go-missing-in-israel-amid-wartime-mass-arrests">six local organisations petitioned Israel’s High Court to disclose</a> the names and locations of the detainees and to ensure humane holding conditions.</p>

<p>Al-Kaabi said the Gulf state, which in 2020 established full diplomatic relations with Israel in a US-brokered deal, is working “relentlessly” to secure a humanitarian ceasefire.</p>
<p>“Every effort must be made to protect civilians and immediately put an end to this conflict,” al-Kaabi added.</p>

<p>“These Hamas attacks are without justification – they deserve global condemnation. But the response by Benjamin Netanyahu’s government also deserves our clearest condemnation,” Boric was quoted as saying by the Reuters news agency after meeting Biden at the White House.</p>
<p>“There’s no doubt we can say the response has been disproportionate and is violating international humanitarian law,” he said.</p>
<p>“The right of a state to defend itself has limits, and those limits imply respecting the lives of innocent civilians, especially children, and respecting civil humanitarian law.”</p>
<p>Asked about Biden’s response, Boric said it was not his place to speak for the US president.</p>

<p>The military is saying that it is also receiving assistance via air and sea, with the Israeli air force and the navy striking targets on the ground and along the coast.</p>
<p>The military said that the fighting in the last 24 hours has resulted in the deaths of 130 fighters inside the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said that it is also going to continue to attack rocket launching sites, military warehouses, as well as tunnel systems.</p>
<p>While they are saying that they have made big gains with this ground operation, they are also suffering heavy losses.</p>
<p>We’ve seen 19 Israeli soldiers killed inside the Gaza Strip. Overall, since the war began on October 7, you are looking at 335 soldiers who have been killed in fighting.</p>

People are now standing on the rubble, picking at the ground with their bare hands, trying to get their loved ones out – even if there is most likely no one still alive under the collapsed buildings.</p>
<p>Al Jazeera’s Hisham Zaqout said that 10 Israeli missiles landed on the camp on Thursday, in an attack that killed at least 15 people, according to Gaza’s Civil Defence. Based on the number of Palestinians searching for people under the rubble, the true death toll is expected to be higher.</p>
<p>Locals described the strikes to Zaqout as turning everything dark, leaving them unable to see those around them or assess the damage visually.</p>

<p>“An earthquake is not as bad as this,” one man told Zaqout. “If you were here, you died. If you were 200, 300 metres away, you also died. What happened is not normal. This wasn’t an earthquake.”</p>
<p>“These missiles are fired on civilians. We hear a phrase a lot in the media: ‘prohibited by international law’. Can no country in the world look at the Palestinian people?” the man added. “We’re not an advanced country for them to hit us like this. Can no Arab country even look at us with mercy?”</p>
<p>Zaqout picked through pictures and notebooks that now sit on the destroyed buildings. “There were families here, but now they’re under the rubble,” he said, as those around him picked at what was left of the buildings with their hands.</p>
<p>One man said he was looking for his sister and her daughter. Another, sat squatting on the rubble, appeared resigned.</p>
<p>“[I’m looking for] my two sisters and their daughters. We’re just sitting here watching and hoping for relief from God. They’re gone now. They’re martyrs, thank God.”</p>

Those are the latest figures from the health authorities.</p>
<p>It began when Israeli special forces, we understand, launched a raid to try and arrest somebody on the outskirts of the refugee camp. They went in undercover, but they were spotted by fighters in Jenin and a gun battle ensued.</p>
<p>The Israelis called in backup, and there was a larger gun battle. Two people were initially killed, and then bulldozers were sent in by the Israeli military. They have these armoured bulldozers they use really to just destroy infrastructure, to dig up the roads.</p>
<p>Somebody threw an IED [improvised explosive device] at that bulldozer, Israel retaliated at the person who filmed it, he was wounded in some sort of missile strike, and the operation continued.</p>

<p>He added that “without American support”, Israel “will be silenced within days”.</p>
<p>Iran is considered by Israel to be its number one threat in the region. It supports different armed groups across the Middle East, including Hamas, and Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<p>“When you’re faced with incapable ground forces who are unable to meet the objectives that you have set out for them, then you turn this territory into a killing field, and engaging in these mass killings, not as a prelude to a successful ground operation, but in large part as an alternative to it,” Rabbani says of the Israeli state’s mentality.</p>
<p>“You have this staggering body count … and thereby satisfy your blood lust and desire for revenge, and can present this as an achievement to your constituents and public opinion,” Rabbani added. “And I think there may be a realisation already among the Israeli leadership that they’re not going to achieve their objectives, and that they will then say, well we razed the Gaza Strip to the ground, we killed thousands upon thousands of people, we imposed a medieval siege on them, don’t tell us we didn’t achieve anything.”</p>

<p>It said that the attack “is a bloody message to terrorise Palestinian journalists”, to stop them from “conveying the suffering of the Palestinian people and exposing the crimes of the occupation”.</p>
<p>The channel said it will continue to carry out its duty “no matter how great the sacrifices are and no matter how many crimes the occupying state commits against our journalists”.</p>
<p>At least 11 people were killed in the Israeli attack, including Abu Hatab.</p>

<ul class="spaced-bullet-spacing">
<li>Voting 226 to 196, largely along party lines, the Republicans passed a plan introduced by new House Speaker Mike Johnson to provide $14.3bn in aid to Israel as it fights Hamas.</li>
<li>The Republican plan provides billions for Israel’s military, including $4bn for procurement of Israel’s Iron Dome and David’s Sling defence systems to counter short-range rocket threats.</li>
<li>The Republicans rejected a much larger emergency spending bill worth $106bn offered by US President Joe Biden, which also covers military aid to Ukraine and Taiwan as well as humanitarian aid.</li>
<li>The bill will most likely be dead on arrival, as Biden had threatened a veto. The Democrat-controlled Senate also said that it would not bring it up for a vote.</li>
<li>Republicans have a 221-212 majority in the House, but Biden’s fellow Democrats control the Senate 51-49.</li>
<li>House Republican leaders said they would cover the cost of the aid to Israel by cutting some funding for the Internal Revenue Service – a proposal Democrats describe as a “poison pill”.</li>
<li>According to estimates by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, IRS cuts and Israel aid in the standalone bill would add nearly $30bn to the US budget deficit, currently estimated at $1.7 trillion.</li>
<li>Democratic Representative Rosa DeLauro said the Republican plan “abandons Ukraine” while adding that the fortunes of Israel and Ukraine “are linked”.</li>
<li>Speaker Johnson, who voted against Ukraine aid repeatedly, said that a separate bill on Ukraine aid “will come next”.</li>

<p>Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging deadly fire across the Israel-Lebanese border since Hamas launched an attack on Israel on October 7. The latest confrontation is considered the deadliest escalation at the frontier since the 2006 war.</p>

<p>In a separate post on social media, the Israeli military said that its priorities “are to bring home the children, women and men who are being held hostage by Hamas and to make sure Hamas will no longer have the ability to attack Israelis. The [Israeli army] is doing everything in its power to achieve this”.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, Hamas’s military wing, the Qassam Brigades, said Gaza would be a “curse” for Israel and that its invading soldiers would go home “in black bags”.</p>
