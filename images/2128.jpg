The evacuees crouched down to protect themselves from the impact of a possible missile strike.\n\nThe metropolitan government has designated 4,258 sites for temporary evacuation to mitigate damage from an incoming missile. These places are mainly public facilities and underground structures.\n\nA participant in his 60s said this was his first missile drill and he learned how he should act quickly in such a situation.\n\nA Tokyo official called on people to quickly flee into sturdy buildings or underground facilities when the J-Alert system sounds an alarm.\n\nThe official said Tokyo plans to hold more drills to inform people about what they should do if there is an emergency.",
