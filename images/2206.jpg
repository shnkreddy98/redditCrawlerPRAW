6 rioter who urged mob to take officers' guns took a secret plea deal, DOJ confirms","articleBody":"WASHINGTON — A Jan. 6 defendant caught on camera using a bullhorn to urge fellow pro-Trump rioters to steal law enforcement officers' guns took a secret plea deal and was sentenced to 2½ years in prison this year, the Justice Department and his legal team acknowledged for the first time in a filing unsealed Monday. Samuel Lazar, a pro-Trump rioter, also shot at a line of officers with pepper spray on Jan. 6, 2021, the government said. Lazar was actively featured on the FBI's Capitol Violence website when he attended an event featuring Rudy Giuliani and former Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano in May 2021. There are more than half a dozen photos of Lazar and Mastriano together at various political events; Mastriano has said that he cannot vet everyone he takes photos with and that anyone who attacked law enforcement should be \"held accountable.\" Lazar was arrested July 27, 2021, the day of the first public hearing of the Jan. 6 committee, which featured the testimony of four of the police officers who protected the Capitol during the attack. At a sealed proceeding in March 2022, Lazar pleaded guilty to a felony charge of assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers, as well as aiding and abetting, and he agreed to cooperate with the government, according to the joint filing unsealed Monday. Lazar was sentenced to 30 months, or 2½ years, in federal prison on March 17, 2023, the filing said. NBC News first reported on Lazar's sentencing the day it happened after it spotted members of his family at the courthouse. Lazar's family members would not say what happened during the proceeding and what sentence Lazar received. The Justice Department declined to comment on Lazar's case at the time. The filing was released after a petition was filed by a media coalition, which includes NBC News. The coalition filed a motion to unseal in April and a renewed motion last week after U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson denied the initial request. The extent of Lazar’s cooperation with the government is unclear. Video shows Lazar on Jan. 6 yelling, \"Let's get their guns! Let's get their guuuuuuunnnns!\" over a bullhorn as rioters fight with police on the west side of the Capitol. Video from later in the day shows Lazar, accompanied by his sister, talking about assaults on law enforcement officers. “They maced us, those tyrannical pieces of s---, and we maced them right the f--- back,\" he said in video cited by the Justice Department. There is no evidence Lazar entered the Capitol. Federal Bureau of Prisons records had indicated that Lazar was set to be released in September 2023, and the bureau told The Associated Press last month that he had been released after having served a sentence for assaulting or resisting a federal officer. The joint filing unsealed Monday confirmed Lazar was released on Sept. 13, having served his 2½-year sentence after credits for good behavior were factored in. In the joint filing unsealed Monday, the Justice Department and Lazar’s defense team requested 30 days to redact the documents before their release, saying \"public dissemination of the information the Defendant supplied could impair or interfere with ongoing investigations and because Defendant named individuals responsible for criminal conduct who may not have been charged.\"","dateCreated":"2023-10-02T15:54:14.000Z","datePublished":"2023-10-02T15:54:14.000Z","dateModified":"2023-10-02T15:54:14.000Z","articleSection":"politics","articleId":"rcna118385","identifier":{"@type":"PropertyValue","propertyID":"uid","value":"rcna118385"},"topics":"","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-03/230317-samuel-lazar-mjf-1406-92ae9a.jpg","caption":"Samuel Lazar at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, 2021."},"author":[{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"Ryan J.

Lazar was featured on the FBI's Capitol Violence website when he went to a May 2021 rally featuring Rudy Giuliani and a former Republican gubernatorial candidate.","content":{"text":["WASHINGTON — A Jan. 6 defendant caught on camera using a bullhorn to urge fellow pro-Trump rioters to steal law enforcement officers' guns took a secret plea deal and was sentenced to 2½ years in prison this year, the Justice Department and his legal team acknowledged for the first time in a filing unsealed Monday.","Samuel Lazar, a pro-Trump rioter, also shot at a line of officers with pepper spray on Jan. 6, 2021, the government said.","Lazar was actively featured on the FBI's Capitol Violence website when he attended an event featuring Rudy Giuliani and former Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano in May 2021. There are more than half a dozen photos of Lazar and Mastriano together at various political events; Mastriano has said that he cannot vet everyone he takes photos with and that anyone who attacked law enforcement should be \"held accountable.\"","Lazar was arrested July 27, 2021, the day of the first public hearing of the Jan. 6 committee, which featured the testimony of four of the police officers who protected the Capitol during the attack.","At a sealed proceeding in March 2022, Lazar pleaded guilty to a felony charge of assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers, as well as aiding and abetting, and he agreed to cooperate with the government, according to the joint filing unsealed Monday. Lazar was sentenced to 30 months, or 2½ years, in federal prison on March 17, 2023, the filing said.","NBC News first reported on Lazar's sentencing the day it happened after it spotted members of his family at the courthouse. Lazar's family members would not say what happened during the proceeding and what sentence Lazar received. The Justice Department declined to comment on Lazar's case at the time.","The filing was released after a petition was filed by a media coalition, which includes NBC News. The coalition filed a motion to unseal in April and a renewed motion last week after U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson denied the initial request.","The extent of Lazar’s cooperation with the government is unclear.","Video shows Lazar on Jan. 6 yelling, \"Let's get their guns! Let's get their guuuuuuunnnns!\" over a bullhorn as rioters fight with police on the west side of the Capitol. Video from later in the day shows Lazar, accompanied by his sister, talking about assaults on law enforcement officers. “They maced us, those tyrannical pieces of s---, and we maced them right the f--- back,\" he said in video cited by the Justice Department. There is no evidence Lazar entered the Capitol.","Federal Bureau of Prisons records had indicated that Lazar was set to be released in September 2023, and the bureau told The Associated Press last month that he had been released after having served a sentence for assaulting or resisting a federal officer. The joint filing unsealed Monday confirmed Lazar was released on Sept. 13, having served his 2½-year sentence after credits for good behavior were factored in.","In the joint filing unsealed Monday, the Justice Department and Lazar’s defense team requested 30 days to redact the documents before their release, saying \"public dissemination of the information the Defendant supplied could impair or interfere with ongoing investigations and because Defendant named individuals responsible for criminal conduct who may not have been charged.\""]},"documentTracing":{"currentMessageId":{"id":"282e57b6-9f8b-428b-87b2-70e4cb1779d9","updatedDate":"Tue Oct 03 2023 03:02:41 GMT+0000
