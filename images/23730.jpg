is described generally in the board document as &quot;a three-step process that holds Peel staff accountable for being critically conscious of how systems operate, so that we can dismantle inequities and foster practices that are culturally responsive and relevant.&quot;</p><p>First, teacher librarians were instructed to focus on reviewing books that were published 15 or more years ago — so in 2008 or earlier.</p><p>Then, librarians were to go through each of those books and consider the widely-used &quot;MUSTIE&#x27;&#x27; acronym adapted from <a href="https://www.canadianschoollibraries.ca/collection-diversity-toolkit/equity-informed-weeding/">Canadian School Libraries</a>. The letters stand for the criteria librarians are supposed to consider, and they include: </p><ul>   <li>Misleading – information may be factually inaccurate or obsolete.               </li>   <li>Unpleasant – refers to the physical condition of the book, may require replacement.</li>   <li>Superseded – book been overtaken by a new edition or a more current resource. </li>   <li>Trivial – of no discernible literary or scientific merit; poorly written or presented.                </li>   <li>Irrelevant – doesn&#x27;t meet the needs and interests of the library&#x27;s community.                </li>   <li>Elsewhere – the book or the material in it may be better obtained from other sources. </li>  </ul><p>The deadline to complete this step was the end of June, according to the document. </p><div><figure class="imageMedia image full"><div class="placeholder"><img loading="lazy" alt="Woman holding a copy of the Diary of Anne Frank and the Very Hungry Catepillar." srcSet="https://i.cbc.ca/1.6964365.1694545664!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/dianne-lawson-libraries-not-landfills.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6964365.1694545664!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/dianne-lawson-libraries-not-landfills.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6964365.1694545664!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/dianne-lawson-libraries-not-landfills.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6964365.1694545664!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/dianne-lawson-libraries-not-landfills.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6964365.1694545664!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/dianne-lawson-libraries-not-landfills.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.6964365.1694545664!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/dianne-lawson-libraries-not-landfills.jpg" style="aspect-ratio:1.441860465116279"/></div><figcaption class="image-caption">Dianne Lawson, a member of Libraries not Landfills, says teachers told her The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank and The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle were removed from their school libraries as part of the PDSB weeding process.    <!-- --> <!-- -->(Nicole Brockbank/CBC)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Step two of curation is an anti-racist and inclusive audit, where quality is defined by &quot;resources that promote anti-racism, cultural responsiveness and inclusivity.&quot; And step three is a representation audit of how books and other resources reflect student diversity.</p><p>When it comes to disposing of the books that are weeded, the board documents say the resources are &quot;causing harm,&quot; either as a health hazard because of the condition of the book or because &quot;they are not inclusive, culturally responsive, relevant or accurate.&quot;</p><p>For those reasons, the documents say the books cannot be donated, as &quot;they are not suitable for any learners.&quot; </p><p>A PDSB spokesperson said the board supports its schools &quot;in the disposal of books in a responsible manner by following Peel Region&#x27;s recycling guidelines.&quot; Peel Region allows for the recycling of book paper, as long as hard covers and any other plastics are removed first and put in the garbage. </p><h2>Books removed based on date, board heard</h2><p>It was during the first stage of the new equitable curation cycle, that Takata, Libraries not Landfills, and at least one trustee, say some schools were removing books strictly based on publication date.</p><p>CBC Toronto recently reviewed a recording of a May 8 board committee meeting focused on the new equitable weeding process. In it, trustee Karla Bailey noted &quot;there are so many empty shelves,&quot; when she walks into schools. </p><p>&quot;When you talk to the librarian in the library, the books are being weeded by the date, no other criteria,&quot; Bailey told the committee. </p><p>&quot;That is where many of us have a real issue.

the anti-racist and inclusive audit in the second phase of the curation cycle would need to document the title and reason for removal before any books were disposed of.</p><p>&quot;We have to make sure that we are meeting the needs of the students and not just rolling something out because we were told to do it,&quot; said Green. </p><p></p><p>When it comes to removing all books published in 2008 or earlier, Green said the board of trustees has heard that, too. </p><p>&quot;We have asked the Director [of Education] again to make sure that if that is taking place, then that is stopped, and then the proper process is followed,&quot; he said.</p><p>Green also said they have plans to communicate with parents about the weeding process.</p><p>In the meantime, students like Takata are left with half-empty shelves and questions about why they weren&#x27;t consulted about their own libraries. </p><p>&quot;No one asked for our opinions,&quot; she said. &quot;I feel that taking away books without anyone&#x27;s knowledge is considered censorship.&quot;</p></div></div><div class="contentFeedback-RoTQP contentFeedback-hjGnu"><div class="bottomSeparator-FdM_L"><a
