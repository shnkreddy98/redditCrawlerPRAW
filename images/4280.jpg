projected electoral vote count, as several states, including Georgia, have yet to be projected.</p><h3>Nov. 10, 2020</h3><p>The Trump campaign requests a hand recount in Georgia, where Biden leads by about 14,000 votes out of nearly 5 million cast in the presidential race.</p><h3>Nov. 11, 2020</h3><p>Raffensperger, a Republican, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/georgias-top-election-official-announces-full-hand-recount/story?id=74146620\" target=\"_blank\">announces</a> that due to how slim the vote margin is between Biden and Trump, the state's planned audit will trigger a \"full by-hand recount in each county\" of the presidential race.</p><p><inline3></p><h3>Nov. 19, 2020</h3><p>The results of Georgia's statewide audit, which entailed that counties recount by hand every vote cast in the presidential race, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/statewide-audit-results-reaffirm-biden-winner-georgia/story?id=74308105\" target=\"_blank\">reaffirm Biden as the winner</a> -- by a margin of 12,284 votes.

The audit found that Biden won by a margin of 11,779 votes.</p><h3>Dec. 22, 2020</h3><p>Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff at the time, visits Georgia's Cobb County to observe a signature match audit.</p><h3>Dec. 23, 2020</h3><p>Amid the signature match audit in Cobb County, Trump <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/december-call-trump-urged-georgia-elections-investigator-find/story?id=75152489\" target=\"_blank\">phones a chief investigator</a> in Raffensperger's office to discuss the audit, telling the investigator they would be praised for finding errors in the vote count, according to an individual familiar with the call.</p><h3>Jan. 2, 2021</h3><p>In an <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-demands-georgia-secretary-state-find-votes-hand/story?id=75027350\" target=\"_blank\">hourlong phone call</a> obtained by ABC News, Trump calls Raffensperger and falsely claims that it was \"not possible\" for him to have lost and asks the secretary to \"find 11,780 votes\" -- the exact number Trump needed to win Georgia.</p><p>\"The people of Georgia are angry. The people of the country are angry, and there's nothing wrong with saying that, you know, that you've recalculated,\" Trump says on the call. \"All I want to do is this: I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. ...
