Firefighters have been responding to the blaze at the Bouldercombe Battery Project, near Rockhampton, since being alerted at 7.45pm on Tuesday. One lithium battery storage unit has caught fire and there are fears others could too. “There are a large number of batteries on site and there is a possibility the fire may spread to other units, creating a larger hazard,” Queensland police said in a statement early on Wednesday. “Work is being done to dowse the surrounding batteries and could continue for several days.” Queensland Fire and Emergency Services has warned nearby residents to keep their windows and doors closed. “Crews are working to bring the fire under control, but large amounts of smoke will impact the area,” QFES said. “Nearby residents should close their windows and doors, and those suffering from a respiratory condition should keep their medications close by.” No one was injured when the fire broke out. Tesla is the battery supplier to the facility but it’s unclear if the corporation’s products are involved in the fire. In a press release on September 4, the facility’s operators Genex Power said the project was “going through final testing” before kicking off commercial operations in October, in time to make the most of the upcoming summer months. Genex said on Wednesday the fire is “being allowed to burn out” under the supervision of authorities. “The fire is currently contained and the site has been disconnected from the grid,” the company said in a statement. “Genex is working with Tesla Motors Australia Pty Ltd and Consolidated Power Projects Pty Ltd to investigate the root cause of the incident.”","thumbnailUrl":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-12027818/bae5138e7a52fd631778c9798ab9765afe2f2cc7-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","url":"https://7news.com.au/business/energy/fears-of-escalation-as-fire-breaks-out-at-bouldercombe-battery-project-near-rockhampton-c-12027818","author":[{"@type":"Person","@id":"https://7news.com.au/profile/warren-barnsley","url":"https://7news.com.au/profile/warren-barnsley","jobTitle":"Brisbane Digital Producer/Journalist","name":"Warren Barnsley","publishingPrinciples":null,"description":"Warren Barnsley is a journalist and producer for 7NEWS.com.au in Brisbane.

a battery energy storage facility in central Queensland, sparking a warning for nearby residents. Firefighters have been responding to the blaze at the Bouldercombe Battery Project, near Rockhampton, since being alerted at 7.45pm on Tuesday. One lithium battery storage unit has caught fire and there are fears others could too. “There are a large number of batteries on site and there is a possibility the fire may spread to other units, creating a larger hazard,” Queensland police said in a statement early on Wednesday. “Work is being done to dowse the surrounding batteries and could continue for several days.” Queensland Fire and Emergency Services has warned nearby residents to keep their windows and doors closed. “Crews are working to bring the fire under control, but large amounts of smoke will impact the area,” QFES said. “Nearby residents should close their windows and doors, and those suffering from a respiratory condition should keep their medications close by.” No one was injured when the fire broke out. Tesla is the battery supplier to the facility but it’s unclear if the corporation’s products are involved in the fire. In a press release on September 4, the facility’s operators Genex Power said the project was “going through final testing” before kicking off commercial operations in October, in time to make the most of the upcoming summer months. Genex said on Wednesday the fire is “being allowed to burn out” under the supervision of authorities. “The fire is currently contained and the site has been disconnected from the grid,” the company said in a statement. “Genex is working with Tesla Motors Australia Pty Ltd and Consolidated Power Projects Pty Ltd to investigate the root cause of the incident.”","thumbnailUrl":"https://images.7news.com.au\u002Fpublication\u002FC-12027818\u002Fbae5138e7a52fd631778c9798ab9765afe2f2cc7-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","url":"https://7news.com.au\u002Fbusiness\u002Fenergy\u002Ffears-of-escalation-as-fire-breaks-out-at-bouldercombe-battery-project-near-rockhampton-c-12027818","author":[{"@type":"Person","@id":"https://7news.com.au\u002Fprofile\u002Fwarren-barnsley","url":"https://7news.com.au\u002Fprofile\u002Fwarren-barnsley","jobTitle":"Brisbane Digital Producer\u002FJournalist","name":"Warren Barnsley","publishingPrinciples":null,"description":"Warren Barnsley is a journalist and producer for 7NEWS.com.au in Brisbane.
