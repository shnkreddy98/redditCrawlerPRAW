Now, arrest documents obtained by the Dallas Morning News show Karlton Dudley spoke to Collin County Sheriff&#x27;s investigators and told them he was arrested for, in his words, &quot;losing his wife&#x27;s body and not hiding the body very well.&quot; </p><div class="nb-ad-placeholder"></div><p> Documents also show Karlton Dudley himself filed a missing person report and reported that a
