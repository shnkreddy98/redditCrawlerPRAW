Moore’s teenage son was in the vehicle’s passenger seat, while Boykins, a friend, was in a backseat.</p><p class="text | article-text">Moore said he pulled over because a highway patrolman was following close behind for long period of time. The trooper’s patrol vehicle did not have lights and sirens on before the stop.</p><p class="text | article-text">Trooper David Peterson asked for his driver’s license. Moore asked him what crime he committed that would warrant needing to provide identification. When Peterson did not initially provide answer, Moore refused to hand over his license.</p><p class="text | article-text">A few minutes later, two county deputies arrived at the scene. After the deputies broke Moore’s driver’s side window, he fled the scene. Peterson and the deputies chased after him.</p><p class="text | article-text">According to the incident report and the dash camera video, Peterson’s speed topped 95 miles per hour. He passed the two deputy patrol cars on a narrow two-lane road at night, eventually reaching Moore’s vehicle and knocking him off the road using a maneuver known as precision immobilization technique (PIT).</p><p class="text | article-text">The maneuver, according to the DOJ, forces a fleeing vehicle to abruptly turn 180 degrees, causing the vehicle to stall and stop.</p><p class="text | article-text">Moore and his son survived the crash, but Boykins did not.</p><p class="text | article-text">Leden Boykins’ mother, Toni, learned about the crash from a neighbor. “I just hung up the phone and I instantly knew,” she recalled. “I called my husband and I was like, something bad has happened.”</p><div class="link-list | article-link-list w-100 p-3 my-3 border-top border-bottom border-light"><div class="px-0 px-sm-3 py-md-3 px-md-5"><h5 class="mb-3 font-weight-bold">MORE COVERAGE FROM AWARD-WINNING INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER ANDY PIERROTTI</h5><div class="card-deck mx-n2 mb-n3"><div class="interstitial-link | article-interstitial-link mb-3 mx-2 card bg-transparent mb-3"><div class="card-body row p-2"><div class="col align-self-center"><h6 class="mb-1 font-weight-bold"><a class="text-reset" href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2023/05/31/officer-claims-he-stopped-pursuit-before-deadly-crash-video-shows-otherwise/?outputType=amp">Woman killed after Marietta police conduct alleged chase against department policy</a></h6><div class=""><p class="mb-0">Atlanta News First uncovered evidence a police officer possibly broke department rules in a police pursuit that ended an innocent woman’s life.

It does not limit pursuits to violent crimes as the DOJ report recommends.</p><p class="text | article-text">Wexler said police need discretion, but they also need parameters to determine under what circumstances law enforcement should participate in high-speed chases. “This, in many ways, this is about the sanctity of human life and how you train police officers and how you supervise police officers,” said Wexler.</p><p class="text | article-text">According to the 160-page report, Congress directed the <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/" target="_blank">National Traffic Safety Administration</a> in 2020 to conduct a study “that would that would lead to the development of accurate reporting and analyses of crashes that involve police pursuits.”</p><h6 class="header | article-header w-100"><b>LISTEN: Behind the Investigation, with award-winning ANF investigative reporters</b></h6><div id="fusion-static-enter:QN2REDTHM5DUHKQTNLRZIQM2OM" style="display:none" data-fusion-component="QN2REDTHM5DUHKQTNLRZIQM2OM"></div><div class="article-raw-html w-100 mb-3"><div><div id='buzzsprout-large-player'></div><script type='text/javascript' charset='utf-8' src='https://www.buzzsprout.com/2175869.js?container_id=buzzsprout-large-player&player=large'></script></div></div><div id="fusion-static-exit:QN2REDTHM5DUHKQTNLRZIQM2OM" style="display:none" data-fusion-component="QN2REDTHM5DUHKQTNLRZIQM2OM"></div><p class="text | article-text">Other recommendations in the report include prohibiting pursuits involving feeling motorcyclists; requiring supervisor approval to continue chases; and only allowing officers with pursuit training to engage in chases.</p><p class="text | article-text">The only pursuit-related issue the report’s working group did not reach consensus involved PIT maneuvers. They could not agree whether the controversial tactic should be outright prohibited or permitted in certain narrowly defined circumstances.</p><p class="text | article-text">Wexler said there are no comprehensive research studies available to address the safety and effectiveness of PIT maneuvers. “You’ll see people doing the PIT maneuver at 30 miles an hour, or at 50 miles an hour or at 80 miles an hour, but no one could tell us at what speed is safe,” he said. “For those reasons, we had serious concerns.”</p><p class="text | article-text">The report also addressed myths associated with strict pursuit policies. For example, it referenced whether or not people only flee from police when they have committed a serious crime.</p><p class="text | article-text">The answer, according to the report: “Research shows more than 90 percent of pursuits are initiated because of traffic violations. The California Highway Patrol’s report on 2020 police pursuits found the top charges upon apprehension were for stolen vehicle, driving under the influence (DUI), resisting arrest, and suspended or unlicensed driver; combined, these accounted for 37 percent of all apprehensions and 22 percent of all pursuits. The most serious charge upon apprehension, attempted murder, accounted for less than 1 percent of apprehensions and less than 0.5 percent of pursuits.”</p><div class="link-list | article-link-list w-100 p-3 my-3 border-top border-bottom border-light"><div class="px-0 px-sm-3 py-md-3 px-md-5"><div class="card-deck mx-n2 mb-n3"><div class="interstitial-link | article-interstitial-link mb-3 mx-2 card bg-transparent mb-3"><div class="card-body row p-2"><div class="col align-self-center"><h6 class="mb-1 font-weight-bold"><a class="text-reset" href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/thesixth/">The Sixth: A series about your constitutional right to an attorney</a></h6><div class=""><p class="mb-0">You have the right to an attorney, but it doesn&#x27;t always work out that way.

Using the Roanoke County and Roanoke City (Virginia) Police Departments, researchers examined the effects of restrictive pursuit policies and found no evidence suggesting that reducing the likelihood of pursuits generates an increase in criminal activity. In fact, under more restrictive pursuit policies, arrest rates declined by approximately two percent.
